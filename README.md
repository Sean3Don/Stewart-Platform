Controlling a Stewart Platform trough Arduino &amp; Processing


Control interface for Stewart Platform

The program sends servo data to the arduino that controls the servos, make sure you change the serial portName to the port you are using.
This program is ment to get you started on how to control a hexapod. Feel free to concact mee if you have any questions.
 
I'm a designer not a programmer, so if you see ways to improve this software please let me know. I would be happy to update this software and keep on improving it in the future.
